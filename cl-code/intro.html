<h1 align="center">Hi!</h1>
<h3 align="center">and Welcome to Lodds</h3>

This is a short Introduction so you can get started right away.

<h2>Overview and Windows</h2>
What you see once you started up Lodds is the Main Window, it has a
User List on the left, Directories you Share on the right and a Info
Section at the bottom. In the middle of the Main Window is a Tree
which displays shared files of all found Lodds clients in the
network. At the Top left you can find the Menubar which contains the
Lodds, View and Help Menus.

<h2>Navigating the Tree</h2>
To open/close a Folder you can click on the Folder Icon on the left of
the Folder. You can also use the Arrow Keys to navigate the tree,
Using <kbd>right</kbd> and <kbd>left</kbd> to open and close.

<h2>Downloading Files</h2>
To download a single File or Folder you can <kbd>Double click</kbd>
the Entry. To Download Multiple Files at once you can select the
entries as usual (Left Click plus <kbd>Shift</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>)
and then either press <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Right Click</kbd> ->
<kbd>Download</kbd>.

<h2>Sharing Files</h2>
To Share a Folder you can either Press <kbd>Ctrl-o</kbd>, click the
'Share Directory' Button at the bottom of the Directory Shared widget
or Drag and Drop a Folder onto the widget. Lodds will then start
tracking the selected Directory and generate Checksums. This might
take a while, depending on how many items the Directory contains and
how big they are. (> 2 gigabyte might take over a minute). Once a
Directory is shared, it also tracks file changes inside it. This means
that when you put new files into a shared folder they will
automatically be shared too (and the other clients will be informed
about the change and update their list).

<h2>Sending Files</h2>
It is also possible to send files to a User. You can click on the
send-file icon on the right side of the Username. This will open up a
Dialog to choose a File and a Timeout. The timeout specifies how much
time the selected user has to accept the File. The Transfer will be
aborted in case the user does not respond withing the time limit, or
denies the request.

<h2>Receiving Files</h2>
When a User wants to send a File to you, a Dialog will pop up and show
you information about the given file and how much time is left to
accept it. You can then choose a name and a location for the incomming
file and accept the request. (or deny it if you dont want it,
obviously)

<h2>Trusting and Blocking of Users</h2>
You are able to Trust/Block a User, but this is only used to auto
accept/block incoming Files. Since there is no way to really identify
a User it would make no sense to implement the blocking of downloads
or similar. This trusting/blocking mechanism is just to ease the
sending of files to multiple user. For example if a user wants to
distribute files from time to time to multiple users everyone can just
auto accept his requests (trust him), instead of everyone downloading
the files from him.

<h2>Settings</h2>
Settings can be opened by pressing <kbd>Ctrl-c</kbd> or by clicking on
the settings entry inside the Lodds Menu. Changed Settings will be
applied once the 'ok' button on the bottom right corner of the
settings dialog is pressed. You can also Save/Load settings to/from a
File and load back the default. The Save File Button has a Tooltip
which tells you what locations will be loaded once Lodds starts up,
these can be used to always save and load your settings on the next
startup.
