For our commit messages, we use a precise format.
This should include a headline before information about specific changes. 

The headline should begin with an commit tag (see below) followed by an optional sub-tag (see also below) and finally end with an comprehensive description of what was made.
Following, list your changes made to the code in some short phrases.
